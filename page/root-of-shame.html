							<h2>Procedural generation of assets</h2>
							<p>"The Art Of"</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Procedural generation of assets is a well known technique widely used in the game industry. It`s used to generate various kinds of objects (meshes), level design (terrain, universe, mazes, dungeons, etc), plot complications, dialogues, sounds, loot, textures, and so on. What all those have in common are: They can be decomposed in small building blocks and assembly rules. Among the reasons for using such constructions one can find:</p>
							<ul>
							  <li>Storage space optimization. For such cases it may be better to store a set of blocks and rules than all the possible combinations generated by it.</li>
							  <li>Computational creativity and diversity. The possibility of generating virtually infinitely different assets, for example, in the level design never facing the same level twice. </li>
							  <li>Time complexity of development of repeated assets. Modeling assets of the same kind with some variation can be time consuming, while generating various of them from the same blocks and rules are easier. A simple example can be hand crafting each tree of a forest versus generating various trees and forming a forest.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Of course there is a downside, to create such generators it`s required to have a deeper knowledge of what is going to be modeled, otherwise one may fail to identify the correct parameters, blocks and rules hence generating assets with inconsistent and artificial appearance.</p>
							<p>The tools behind of procedural generation are the rewriting rules, related to grammar, and probabilistic distributions. Taking the specific case of meshes, both play important rules on the assembly of an object. The first controls the general structure of a model while the second introduce the variations in the appearance per object.</p>
							<p>Here we are going to address the generation of plant`s root meshes based on simple rules.</p>

									<h3>Rewrite rule</h3>
									<p>The base for the construction of the skeleton lies in the following rewrite rule:</p>
									<p>Given the alphabet {s,l,r,$}, "s" represents a piece of a segment, "l" turn to left by θ degrees, "r" turn to right by θ degrees and "$" the ending of a segment. Then we use the rules "$" → "a$", the growing of a segment, "$" → ("a$", "la$") and  "$" → ("a$", "ra$"), the branching and one step growing of a segment to left and right respectively. One important thing to notice is that we start with a single chain but may end with many, as the branching rules initiate new chains which grow independently. One may notice we have three rules for the same symbol "$", here is where the probability distribution comes in, you can assign probabilities for each rule and sample obtaining different constructions.</p>

									<h3>Noise Addition</h3>
									<p>From a visual inspection it`s perceptible that only branching with straight lines and fixed segments size does not achieve what is proposed. So one way of making it more natural is adding noise in each step.</p>
									<p>We sample a δL (length) and δθ (angle) from a normal distribution and add it to the grown of each segment for each step. These noises simulates a continuous process where it grows a random length until it changes its growing direction a little bit.</p>

									<h3>Growth animation</h3>
									<p>Generating the frames for the animation during the simulation is straightforward, after each epoch (an epoch means each branch have been visited and updated) one generate the surface and draw it. In the other hand generating the frames after the simulation one must keep track of the epochs.</p>
